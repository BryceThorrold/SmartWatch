# SmartWatch
Week 4 - Smartwatch Data Gathering


There are 2 separate datasets (Train and Test) that comprise the same variables variables, extracted and derived from smart watches when individual subjects perform 1 of 6 activities.

Each of these 2 datasets is consolidated from 3 separate data files, each file sequenced using the same specific time band method
The 3 files used are
-	The actual data from the smartphone, captured across 66 different variables
-	The subject performing that activity (a number form 1-30)
-	The type of activity being performed (a number from 1-6)

These files are consolidated into two files, named TestData and TrainData, with an additional column identifying from which of the two DataSets it comes from, either Train or Test.

These two files are then combined into 1 single file, called SmartWatchData
